## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a Computer Science student interested in software development and technology in general.

Right now, my focus is on:

- building strong programming fundamentals  
- understanding how systems and operating systems work  
- learning Linux and networking basics  
- exploring cybersecurity concepts step by step  
- improving through hands-on practice  

No shortcuts. Just consistency.
